In this group project I led a team of 4 to develop a prototype  of an autonomous rover.

We used an RC car as a base (basic chassis, wheels, differential, motor). 
I designed a part *using metal sheet fabrication* to position all the sensors and controllors on the rover.

The rover used <a href="http://www.ros.org/" target="blank">ROS</a> to speed up the development time. The motor was controlled with an Arduino. I designed and made the odometry sensor that helped (it was one of the sensors used in our kalman filter) to determine the position of the robot. Finnaly we used an Asus Xtion (Kinect equivalent) to gather extra information about the position of the robot in it's environment.
