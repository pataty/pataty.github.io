Last year, KUKA France organized a year long 3D printing student competition with 100 participating students.

The students were to design a bridge that would be printed using a robot.

</div>

As part of my internship at KUKA France, I developed the software for the 3D printer used in the competition. I:
* planned manufacturing of the 3d printer
* determined optimal Robot parameters
* programmed Robot to execute 3d printing trajectory (using cloud robotics)
* designed electronics to control the printing temperature

Throughout the project I applied  Agile development methods.

	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

I also was the technical Advisor for the competition:
* I supervised printing of the students' designs for the competition
* Graded Student Assignments
* Was the Technical Advisor for participating students.
