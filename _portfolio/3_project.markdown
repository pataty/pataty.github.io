During my internship at the  <a href="https://iit.it" target="blank">Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia</a> I joined research team working on an autonomous maintenance system in the Large Haedron Collider at the CERN.

I developed a cloud interface to control the robot. This interface enabled the team to:
* Control the robot with any device (mobile, tablet or laptop)
* Send motion commands to the robot
* Visualise robot motion from within the interface


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/jsp.png" alt="" title="Interface example"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/lhc.jpg" alt="" title="LHC"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/kmr.jpg" alt="" title="KMR iiwa"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">

</div>

Using this interface, the team could speed up their code testing process by spending less time deploying the code to the robot.
