As a member of the Arts et Métiers Camera Club, I made several videos including:
* A short video to promote Arts et Métiers and it's vibrant student life
* Trailers to increase attendance of student event
* Videos of past events to promote the events for following years
* Behind the scenes videos to show the work envolved in student projects


Here are two examples of videos I have worked on.

I took part with my team in the planning, the filming, the editing and the post production of the movies.
