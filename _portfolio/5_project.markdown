During my first year in college my team and I organized a solidarity project to help 40 under privileged children in Peru. We renovated a part of their activity center, financially supported children activities throughout the year and tutored the students. 

Over the course of 2 years, we raised 12 000 dollars through various fundraisers and sponsorships to help the children. 

This was an important experience for me in which my actions made an impact for under privileged children.
