During my first year in college my team and I organized a solidarity project to help in a 40 under priviledged children in Peru. We renovated a part of their activity center, financially supported children activities throughout the year and tutored the students. 

Over the course of 2 years, we raised 12 000 dollars through various fundraisers and sponsorships to help the children. 

This was an important experience for me in which I learnt to undertake a great project with as a team to make an impact for under privileged children.
