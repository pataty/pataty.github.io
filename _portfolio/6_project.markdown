In this Computer Science class at Georgia Tech I studied and implemented a large variety of Machine Learning Algorithms for robotics including:
* Linear Regression
* Machine Vision Algorithms (Pre processing, hough transforms, point clouds etc) using openCV and PCL (point cloud library)
* Location and Mapping (particle filter, Kalman filter etc)
* Deep Learning and CNN (convolutional neural networks) using Caffe


The algorithms were implemented in a simulated environment using Python and C++.
