In this project, I worked on all the steps from the design phase to the actual manufacturing over the course of a semester at Arts et MÃ©tiers. This hands on project gave me a lot of insight about product design as I was able to see the consequences of my decisions that I took at the design phase on the actual product.

The product chosen in class was a wooden beehive.

The first step was to do the detailed design of the product. I used the functional dimensioning method to set the required dimensions, clearances and tolerances for the product.

Then, I planned the process to machine all the parts of the product. This involved choosing:
* the machines 
* the tools
* the cutting speeds
* how the part would be positioned maintained in place
* the optimal order of operations 

All these elements were whose chosen in order to respect the tolerances found in the first step.

Finally I manufactured the parts based on the plans I had made during the planning phase. This hands on experience helped me gain some insight about the machines and their usage.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic. 
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above: 

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
