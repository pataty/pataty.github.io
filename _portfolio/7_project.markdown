In this project, I worked on all the steps from the design phase to the actual manufacturing over the course of a semester at Arts et Métiers. This hands on project gave me a lot of insight about product design as I was able to see the consequences of my decisions that I took at the design phase on the actual product.

The product chosen in class was a wooden beehive.

The first step was to do the detailed design of the product. I used the functional dimensioning method to set the required dimensions, clearances and tolerances for the product.

Then, I planned the process to machine all the parts of the product. This involved choosing:
* the machines 
* the tools
* the cutting speeds
* how the part would be positioned maintained in place
* the optimal order of operations 

All these elements were whose chosen in order to respect the tolerances found in the first step.

Finally I manufactured the parts based on the plans I had made during the planning phase. This hands on experience helped me gain some insight about the machines and their usage.
