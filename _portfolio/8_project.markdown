One of my missions as an intern at the innovation department was to carry out feasibility studies for clients. 
Clients would seek advice about innovative smart industry products used at KUKA that they wanted to use in their processes such as collaborative robots, smart grippers, vision systems, iot actuators etc. 


They would provide me with the parts they wanted to assemble using smart industry technology (most of the time because traditional means were not usable). I would develop a prototype to meet their requirements to prove the feasibility of their project using smart industry technology.

To carry out my studies, I:
* Designed adaptors between the part to assemble and the robot using CAD software (Solidworks)
* Printed the part I had designed (using an Ultimaker printer)
* *Found Creative solutions to solve the clients problems* (using sensitive or collaborative robots, vision, autonomous platforms etc)
* Wrote robot trajectories to perform the task wanted to the client
* Demonstrated the solution to the client
