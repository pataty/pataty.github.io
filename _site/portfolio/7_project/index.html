  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In this project, I worked on all the steps from the design phase to the actual manufacturing over the course of a semester at Arts et Métiers. This hands on project gave me a lot of insight about product design as I was able to see the consequences on the actual product of the decisions I took during the design phase.</p>

<p>The product chosen in class was a wooden beehive.</p>

<p>The first step was to do the detailed design of the product. I used the functional dimensioning method to set the required dimensions, clearances and tolerances for the product.</p>

<p>Then, I planned the process to machine all the parts of the product. This involved choosing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the machines</li>
  <li>the tools</li>
  <li>the cutting speeds</li>
  <li>how the part would be positioned maintained in place</li>
  <li>the optimal order of operations</li>
</ul>

<p>All these elements were chosen in order to respect the tolerances found in the first step.</p>

<p>Finally I manufactured the parts based on the plans I had made during the planning phase. This hands on experience helped me gain some insight about the machines and their usage.</p>
