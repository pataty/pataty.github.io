  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In this project, I worked on all the steps from the design phase to the actual manufacturing over the course of a semester at Arts et Métiers. This hands on project gave me a lot of insight about product design as I was able to see the consequences of my decisions that I took at the design phase on the actual product.</p>

<p>The product chosen in class was a wooden beehive.</p>

<p>The first step was to do the detailed design of the product. I used the functional dimensioning method to set the required dimensions, clearances and tolerances for the product.</p>

<p>Then, I planned the process to machine all the parts of the product. This involved choosing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the machines</li>
  <li>the tools</li>
  <li>the cutting speeds</li>
  <li>how the part would be positioned maintained in place</li>
  <li>the optimal order of operations</li>
</ul>

<p>All these elements were whose chosen in order to respect the tolerances found in the first step.</p>

<p>Finally I manufactured the parts based on the plans I had made during the planning phase. This hands on experience helped me gain some insight about the machines and their usage.</p>

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image" />
	<img class="col one" src="/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image" />
	<img class="col one" src="/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic. 
</div>

<p>You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, <em>bled</em> for your project, and then…. you reveal it’s glory in the next row of images.</p>

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image" />
	<img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here’s the code for the last row of images above:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class="img_row"&gt;
  &lt;img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/&gt;
  &lt;img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
