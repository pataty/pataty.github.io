  <article class="post-content">
    <p>One of my missions as an intern at the innovation department was to carry out feasibility studies for clients. 
Clients would seek advice about innovative smart industry prodcuts used at KUKA that they wanted to use in their processes such as collaborative robots, smart grippers, vision systems, iot actuators etc.</p>

<p>They would provide me with the parts they wanted to assemble using smart industry technology (most of the time because traditional means were not usable). I would develop a prototype to meet their requirements to prove the feasibility of their project using smart industry technology.</p>

<p>To carry out my studies, I:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designed adaptors between the part to assemble and the robot using CAD software (Solidworks)</li>
  <li>Print the part I had designed (using an Ultimaker printer)</li>
  <li><em>Found Creative solutions to solve the clients problems</em> (using senstive or collaorative robots, vision, autonomous platforms etc)</li>
  <li>Write robot trajectories to perform the task wanted to the client</li>
  <li>Demontrate the solution to the client</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image" />
	<img class="col one" src="/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image" />
	<img class="col one" src="/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic. 
</div>

<p>You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, <em>bled</em> for your project, and then…. you reveal it’s glory in the next row of images.</p>

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image" />
	<img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here’s the code for the last row of images above:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class="img_row"&gt;
  &lt;img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/&gt;
  &lt;img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
