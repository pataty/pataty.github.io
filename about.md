I am currently pursuing a Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I will be graduating in December 2017.

I am passionate about innovation and pushing technology to the next level with mechanical systems.

Throughout my studies and my internships (that are listed on my <a href="/data/Jean-Baptiste_Murphy.pdf" target="blank">resume</a>) I've acquired skills in Mechanical Engineering, Robotics and Machine Vision.
